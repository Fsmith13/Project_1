			<p>James Harden has recently has been going on a historic scoring run that has now matched one of the all time greats. He has gone on a 16 game streak of scoring 30+ points. This ties Kobe Bryant's streak in 2003. These two streaks have been the longest 30-point game streaks since Wilt Chamberlain's streak of 20 games.

Harden didn't shoot well from 3-point range, he went just 1-17 from three point range. He did get fouled 3 times from beyond the arc and finished the game making 15 out of his 16 freethrows. Harden shot 11-for-32 from the field. Despite his off night James Harden has made history. Along with his historic run James Harden has tied Damon Stoudamire's record for most missed three pointers in NBA history with his 16 missed threes.</p>

			<p>Reports have come out that Chicago Bulls' Center Robin Lopez wants to secure a buyout from the Chicago Bulls to join the superteam the Golden State Warriors. Chicago has no intentions of letting the center leave to join the all ready formidable Warriors. Lopez told Yahoo Sports "I don't think there's an NBA Plalyer that doesn't want to be on a winning team, a playoff team. I feel like I’m kind of smack dab in the middle of the prime of my career. Who doesn’t relish playing in playoff situations? That’s something very appealing and whether that’s something the organization and myself come together and decide, that’s something we want to work towards with this team, or whether that’s something that’s going to happen somewhere else, I’m just going to keep grinding. I think right now we definitely aspire to be a winning team, and I want to help out with that." There has been a report that Robin Lopez hasn't talked directly to management about his future with the team.</p>
